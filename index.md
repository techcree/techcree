**Welcome to my GitHub Pages**

Welcome to my GitHub website, the place for my projects with extensive information and programming code!

I would be happy if you like it and find something useful for you. Of course you can also copy and change the programming code and use it freely for non-commercial purposes. Please note, however, that I assume no liability! So if for some reason the code doesn't work in your environment or causes damage, you have to take responsibility yourself. Some program codes are related to projects where circuits are made. Always be careful and especially with projects involving electricity, the rule is always to take the necessary precautionary measures. If you are not yet of legal age (18+) or not yet old enough to carry out projects on your own, then always inform an adult or legal guardian if you want to do something with electricity. Don't risk anything!

Everything you need to know about me can be found on my website www.stskanta.de where you can also find the imprint and disclaimer. Everything is also regulated there for this GitHub website! Of course you can also find a lot of information about projects and code in some of my posts on my blog. I would be happy if you visit my blog more often and enjoy the content of my posts there! If the posts are about programming, you can usually find the code here on my GitHub page. As said, feel free to use it and adapt it to your needs! It's important to me that you enjoy programming and that we all learn something from it!

By the way - my real name is of course not TechCree. Cree is an Indian tribe, so Tech Indian is my synonym on the blog because it's easier to remember. I chose Cree to honor the native tribes. I myself have spent a long time in North America and want to use my presence on the internet to draw attention to these people!

Stephan Skanta, that's my real name! So thank you for visiting my site and have fun and success. If you have any questions or suggestions, please email me. You can find the address on my website. Or use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/STSKANTA)!

And here is some content / projects:

- [Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/techcree/RaspberryPiTools.git)
- [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://github.com/techcree/PiPico)
- [All Repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/techcree)


P.S.: In the course of time I will provide you with further information on projects with pictures, so it is definitely worth visiting the website here more often!


Your
  TechCree
