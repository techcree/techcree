**Welcome to my GitHub Pages**


Welcome to my GitHub website, the place for my projects with extensive information and programming codes!


I would be happy if you enjoy it and find something useful for you. Of course, you can also copy and change the programming code. But please always note that I do not assume any liability! So always be careful and with projects that have to do with electricity, the rule to take the necessary precautionary measures always applies. If you are not yet an adult, then always inform a legal guardian if you want to do something with electricity and don't risk anything!


Everything you need to know about me can be found on my mainwebsite in the disclaimer information and of course you can also find a lot of information in my blog. I would be happy if you visit my blog more often and enjoy the content of my posts there! If the posts are about programming, you can of course find the code here on GitHub. As I said, you are welcome to use it and adapt it to your needs! It is important to me that you have fun programming and that we all learn something from it!


My real name is of course not TechCree. Cree is an Indian tribe, so Technik Indian is my name, which is easier to remember than Stephan Skanta, because that's my name! So thank you for visiting my site and have fun and success. If you have any questions or suggestions, please write to me! There is also my email address or my contact form in my blog or on my main website!

And here you will find content / projects on the following topics:

- [Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/techcree/RaspberryPiTools.git)
- [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://github.com/techcree/PiPico)
- [All Repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/techcree)


P.S.: In the course of time I will provide you with further information on projects with pictures, so it is definitely worth visiting the website here more often!


Your
  TechCree
